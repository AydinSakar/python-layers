# PubSub Example  #
###################

# This example generates a simple topology with specified numbers of feeds and
# inboxes. Inboxes are randomly subscribed to feeds. Each feed and inbox is then
# run in its own thread. Feeds post a specified number of messages, waiting a
# random interval between messages. Each inbox is polled for messages received,
# terminating when no messages are received for a wait limit.
